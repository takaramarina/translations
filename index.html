    <br><br>
    Kobayashi Senko was a long forgotten artist. Born in 1870 in Jigozen Town in Saiki District, Hiroshima Prefecture (in modern day Hatsukaichi), he traveled to America’s West Coast in 1888 in order to study. After three years, he started to learn painting at an art school in San Francisco, eventually graduating with great results. Although he temporarily went back to Japan in 1898 to see his sick mother, he relocated to Hawaii and worked as an artist until 1900, then headed to Europe. After learning artistic skills in London, Paris, and Italy, he returned to Japan in 1903 and eventually appeared in Tokyo’s art scene. Unfortunately, since he passed away from illness in 1911, his life as an artist in Tokyo is limited to the three years between 1905 and 1908, after which he returned home due to his illness. 
<br><br>
    The first time Senko broke out into the mainstream art scene was at the Tenth Hakuba-Kai in 1905. Senko joined Hakuba-Kai through Kuroda Kiyotaka and Okada Saburosuke, who he met during his time in Paris. However, since he had received his art education in America, his success as an artist in Japan was not guaranteed. The art critics in Meiji Japan pointed out his unique background, stating that he was unlike other artists of this period. After his death, his name disappeared for a long time from Japan’s art history. 
<br><br>
    The reemergence of Senko’s name occurred during the 1980s, approximately seventy years after his death. After his family discovered his works from his family’s home in 1973, they gifted them to the Hiroshima Prefectural Museum. These works were placed in a permanent exhibition by the museum in 1984, after which his name became widely known as an influential artist in Hiroshima’s Western art. Despite this, there still remains much research left to be done on his contributions.
<br><br>
    The difficulty of researching Senko is a result of the scarcity of works and materials as well as his short career in Japan due to his lengthy life in America. It is quite a feat to examine Senko’s path through San Francisco and Honolulu almost one hundred years ago. However, as a Western-style painter who studied in America rather than Paris, the center of art at the time, his presence is an insightful topic of research.
<br><br>
    What did Senko learn in America and Europe, and what did he hope to achieve in Japan? This article will first examine the background behind Senko’s decision to study abroad as well as his experience while he was there. Then, through the analysis of his three major works 「ミルクメイド」(Milkmaid),「パッション」 (Passion), and 「誘惑」(Temptation), it will analyze Senko’s influence from America and Europe’s art education, the reactions he received in Japan, and the direction of the Japanese art industry at the end of the Meiji era. 
<br><br>
    <b>Kobayashi Senko and America<br><br></b>
After Japan opened its borders following the Perry expedition in 1854, many Japanese students traveled to America to study Western topics and skills. However, Japanese artists seeking to study Western painting more often went to Europe, especially Paris, the “capital of art.” As a young country, America was seen as lacking in traditional culture worthy of learning, instead acting as a stopping point for those on their journey across the Pacific Ocean to Europe. However, for those lacking in funds, America had the opportunity for a work-study abroad, which allowed students to immerse themselves in Western culture, simultaneously working and studying. 
<br><br>
    Although Senko went to America to study, he did not have a particular goal in mind. His journey was a result of the encouragement for young people to seek success overseas rather than staying in their hometowns. As the son of a successful merchant, Senko had received an education in Chinese literature and was not seeking to go to America in the search for a job or material success. This could be seen in his decision to go to San Francisco, a city in mainland America,  rather than Hawaii, the common destination for those seeking jobs through agriculture. 
<br><br>
    As a country that had emerged only a century ago, America was in need of cheap labor in order to build infrastructure. In particular, San Francisco, with its booming population after the Gold Rush (?), was experiencing a transformation into a major city, urgently requiring laborers. San Francisco became a prominent place of cultural significance on the West Coast due to a booming economy and an emerging upper middle class and its corresponding emphasis on education. As a result, San Francisco was a prime location for study abroad students, who could come into contact with Western art but also find job opportunities to support themselves in America.
<br><br>
    According to the government census in 1890, out of the 2,039 Japanese individuals residing in America, 1,147 lived in California, and a majority of those were work-study students in San Francisco. Many of these students, who had limited financial resources, lived with American families, doing odd jobs and learning English through school (“schoolboys”). Senko was one of these work-study students. He had been learning English through night school, but after meeting a Japanese student who was attending art school, he became so intrigued by art that he enrolled in art school the following September. 
<br><br>
    Thanks to the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in 1869, it became possible to obtain valuable information in San Francisco despite its distance from the East Coast, leading to artists and intellectuals seeking more freedom to come from Eastern America and Europe. Surrounded by oceans and mountains and filled with art supporters and wealthy individuals, San Francisco became a place of rapid growth in the art industry. Following the short-lived California League of Artists and the San Francisco League of Artists, the San Francisco Art Association was established in 1871. Three years later, the California School of Design was established as the first art school on the West Coast.
<br><br>
    This California School of Design was where Senko enrolled, and it has acted as a significantly influential entity in the growth of artists on the American West Coast. During Senko’s time as a student there, it became a part of the University of California and was renamed Mark Hopkins Institute of Art. The professors at this institution were talented artists with experience in America’s East Coast, Paris, or other parts of Europe, and were now the faces of artists representing California. In particular, Mark Hopkins had heavy French influence, with curriculum taken from Paris’s Ecole Des Beaux-Arts. As Raymond L. Wilson pointed out, the students at Mark Hopkins were able to learn fundamental artistic knowledge comparable to New York, Paris, and Munchen. 
    <br><br>
    Out of the Japanese artists who studied at Mark Hopkins, Senko was a prominent figure. For example, in an article published by San Francisco Examiner on September 29, 1895 titled “The Talent of a Japanese,” Senko is mentioned as having extraordinary improvements in his work, becoming one of the top students in the class. Since Senko worked his way through school, it took him six years instead of the usual four, but he was the top student in his class when he graduated in 1896. At end-of-year exhibitions at the university, he received the 1896 W.E. Brown medal, given to the best figure drawing, and the 1897 Benjamin P. Avery medal, given to the best oil painting. 
        <br><br>
    The news of these awards were featured not only by Japanese newspapers, such as the Daily Japan Herald, but also by prominent English publications, such as the San Francisco Examiner and the San Francisco Chronicle. In the May 20th, 1896 issue of the San Francisco Chronicle, Senko is listed as a Japanese artist among the winners of the awards. Senko later recalls that these awards were extremely competitive, with more than three hundred competing. In fact, this was California’s most competitive art exhibition, with the judges being composed of five distinguished California artists. To be awarded a prize in this exhibition despite tensions of racism as a Japanese artist must have been a great honor for Senko.
<br><br>
    During the 1890s in San Francisco, the increase of Japanese immigrants led to increased tensions, especially by those feeling that Chinese and Japanese immigrants were stealing their jobs. Because of this, the news that Senko, a Japanese immigrant, had received an award proved that there were intellectuals among Japanese immigrants in San Francisco, serving as a powerful message for the Japanese immigrant community. Mark Hopkins proved that they would be willing to award skillful works, regardless of the background of the artist, even if they might be Japanese. This stamp of approval was a key component of Senko’s success as an artist in America.
<br><br>
After momentarily returning to Japan in 1898, Senko decided to go abroad again to research art, and in order to obtain the funds to do so, he relocated to Honolulu from August 11th, 1898 to October of 1900. His cousin operated a hotel for Japanese customers there, so it was relatively easy to establish ways of living and income. He held individual art classes and drew portraits for local famous people. Western art in Hawaii around the 1890s and 1900s was still in its early stages. Thus, as a Japanese artist with formal education from America, Senko was readily accepted by Hawaiian art circles.
<br><br>
    Senko also sold art in New York, Boston, Chicago, and other American cities to make money for his upcoming trip abroad. It was popular in nineteenth century America to have individual portraits painted by an artist. Many of Senko’s pieces were these portraits, which is a major reason why many of his works remain unknown. Portraits were painted under the direction of the commissioner and kept by the individual, not the artist. Nineteenth century America’s economy and art industry gave Senko the opportunity to study at a famous art school and plan his own career path, but many of his works were lost in the process as well.
<br><br>
After leaving Europe, Senko stayed in San Francisco and Honolulu for a year again from 1902 before returning to Japan. At that time, Senko’s name could be seen in Japanese newspapers as an artist with high potential who had received formal art education in America and Europe. For Japanese individuals living in America, Senko was respected and admired as a pioneer who had received high praise in a foreign country. His time studying in Western countries paired with the connections he formed with Japanese artists abroad, including Kuroda Kiyotaka, seemed to promise his success as an artist in Japan. However, after returning to Japan, Senko would face the harsh words of the Japanese art industry to artists returning home from America.
<br><br><b>America seen in Milkmaid</b><br><br>
    Senko’s most famous piece Milkmaid was shown on exhibition in the Tenth Hakuba-Kaiten in 1905. The Hakuba-Kaiten served as Senko’s introduction to the mainstream art industry, becoming the singular most important event in his career in Japan. He submitted 22 works, but his works, contrasting the “Pleinairisme” (外光派) style of other artists, divided the voices of critics. Among many critiques, the November 20, 1905 issue of 日付美術新報 praises the piece, pointing out its foreign feeling and finding a straightforward intention. Foreign feeling likely results from the subject clearly being a Western farm wife as well as a distinct way of coloring the nature in the background. Milkmaid was painted in 1897 in San Francisco, when Senko was working as an artist after obtaining a studio in the city post graduation a year prior. The June 8th, 1896 issue of a Japanese San Francisco newspaper (日本語新聞桑港時事) reports that Senko was often hired by wealthy individuals to create art for them. Although the process or model of Milkmaid is unclear, its style reveals the status of California’s art industry during the 1890s. 
<br><br>
Milkmaid’s color and style reveals that Senko had been influenced by the Barbizon School. Although this movement occurred in the village of Barbizon, on the outskirts of Paris, during the mid 19th century, it did not reach peak influence in California until much later, in the 1890s. In particular, tonalist artists took Barbizon influence and turned it into something more poetic and idealistic. Using a distinct softness in shadows and colors, they took landscapes and emphasized the ambiance rather than portraying it as it naturally occurred. Since tonalist artists started their activity in California during the 1890s, it is logical to assume that Senko was influenced and experimented with his own take on the movement. 
<br><br>
As stated earlier, during the late 19th century, intellectuals and artists from Eastern America and Europe came to California looking for freedom and abundance of nature. A famous artist from this time, George Inness (1825-1894) came to San Francisco in 1891, leaving a series of paintings heavily influenced by the Barbizon style. William Keith (1838-1911) worked together with Inness, being influenced by him and eventually creating pieces that emphasized the atmosphere of landscapes. Furthermore, Arthur Frank Matthews (1860-1945), one of the professors at Mark Hopkins during Senko’s time there, was a tonalist artist representative of California during the late 19th to early 20th century.
<br><br>
Indeed, Milkmaid had a foreign feel, especially when compared to the “Pleinairisme” (外光派) style that was common in Hakiba-Kaiten. Despite it being called the main event of the exhibition (今回の花形), many criticisms were directed toward this unconventionality. For example, in the October 3rd, 1905 issue of the daily newspaper, Sakai Saisui asserts that although the piece stood out due to its unique coloring and therefore received public attention, there was no real quality to the piece. More harsh criticisms attack his works as having an American smell, stating that they do not want to see this type of work being mixed among those carefully created by Japanese artists.
<br><br>
It can be assumed that these comments of “American smell” can be applied to Milkmaid and 「米国写景」(Images of American Landscapes). Furthermore, the Japanese art industry’s strong emphasis on European directions of art and its dislike of American art is apparent. Senko’s works exhibited by Hakuba-Kaiten included works created in Europe and Japan, such as 「広島夏の川」(Summer River in Hiroshima) (1903) illustrated in light colors with pastels, but this piece is never referenced by critics. The comments on Senko’s works were generally driven by his American oil paintings, which left a stronger impression on the audience.
<br><br>
<b>Europe and Passion</b><br><br>
His time in Europe, mainly Paris, left two strong influences on Senko. First, he was able to create connections with other Japanese artists who resided there, including Kuroda Kiyotaka and Okada Saburosuke. Although his time in Europe was only eight months, from December 1900 to August 1901, the connections he formed allowed him to join circles such as Hakuba-Kai and teach at prestigious schools, building credibility in Japanese society. 
<br><br>
A major component of Senko’s life in Paris was centered on パンテオン会 (Pantheon Group), a group of Japanese students residing in Paris. This group not only included artists such as Kuroda Kiyotaka and Okada Saburosuke but also students from all subjects, such as law, education, and linguistics. With membership for life, the group often created publications from the members’ writing and art, and periodically gathered to meet in person. Interestingly, while groups were often divided in Japan according to movements and styles (such as with hakuba-kai, taiheiyougakai, nihonga), the Pantheon Group focused on deep connections with all of its members despite their background. As such, it was only natural that Senko, despite his unique style and education, was able to join Hakuba-Kai later through the connections he made at Pantheon Group.
<br><br>
The second major influence Senko received from Europe was a further understanding of the foundational education he had initially received in America. His long time spent in America must have provided some point of reference for understanding religious materials, and he had opportunities to learn about European cultural works through art history classes at Mark Hopkins. However, through allegorical works encountered during the 1900s, Senko received a strong sense of traditional European painting influence. In other words, through famous works encountered through Europe’s museums, Senko was able to grasp a strong sense of Christian themes and aesthetics.
<br><br>
One example is Passion, which he created in 1901 for an exhibition in Paris. Showing a man accompanied by two angels struck by an arrow from a woman, it is often described as an image of martyrdom. This is likely because the image of the stricken man is reminiscent of Saint Sebastian illustrated throughout the Italian Renaissance. It is quite possible that Senko, when imagining a man’s form, thought of Saint Sebastian, who is often portrayed in European art. However, rather than portraying a true martyr in a religious context, he created a metaphorical painting of a man who gave his body for love. Before Passion, Senko’s works were mostly portraits and landscapes, not metaphorical or idealistic. Through the research of European works of art, he most likely decided to try this new idealistic style of painting in his own works.
<br><br>
This is not to say that Senko did not have the opportunity to explore these styles in America. It is more accurate to say that he got to utilize the knowledge he gained in America through his research in Europe, resulting in works such as Passion. The previously mentioned Arthur Frank Matthews, professor at Mark Hopkins, was not only a tonalist artist but also created works in portrait and historical styles. Together with his wife Lucia Matthews (1870-1955), he was known for his decorative art style. During his time as a professor, Matthews encouraged his students to create their own styles and to study abroad in Paris, and these words seemed to have taken root in Senko’s life direction.
<br><br>
<b>Risou-Ga (Idealistic painting) 「誘惑」(Temptation) and Japanese Art Industry</b>
<br><br>
After his return to Japan, Senko slowly stopped painting Western subjects, instead painting subjects more suited to his Japanese audience. Painted in 1904, a year after his return, 「中道」(Middle Path) can be seen as an experimental piece showing Senko’s directions as an artist. Middle Path shows a goddess on the left, Buddha in the center, and a saddened woman on the right. Sengo’s ultimate goal was to take the skills he learned during his time abroad and modify them to make them more Japanese. 
<br><br>
The criticism for Middle Path, exhibited at the tenth Hakuba-Kaiten, was harsh. For example, the October 27th, 1905 issue of a newspaper (日付時事新報) stated that expressions of religious figures by Japanese artists lacked depth, only resulting in fleeting feelings but no strong feelings long-term. In other words, these idealistic styles of art were still new in the Japanese art industry, and were not readily accepted by people still looking for realistic styles of art. 
<br><br>
「誘惑」(Temptation) is a painting Senko submitted in 1907 to a Tokyo exhibition (東京府勧業展覧会). Although popular at the exhibition (along with Aoki Shigeru’s 「わだつみのいろこの宮」), it was ultimately not awarded any awards. The top award went to Nakamura Fusetsu’s 「建国創業」(Building Country Production), but due to rumors of unfairness in the judging process, Fusetsu declined the prize. Curiously, these three individuals all work with idealistic paintings representative of Japan during this time. It was obvious from the respective titles of their works that Aoki’s works handled mythologies, and Fusetsu’s works focused on building countries. However, it was less evident what Senko’s work was exactly about.
<br><br>
In「三宅克己君に与ふ」featured in the Japanese Newspaper from July 21-23 of 1907, opinions were divided on seeing the complicated idealistic paintings as curious, with some in favor of the difficult process of decoding the metaphors while others were more interested in a traditional, realistic style of art. The March 25th issue of Tokyo Daily Newspaper states that Temptation does not entice genuine interest, having too many focal points, and that it is still difficult for Japanese artists to create the types of idealistic works popular in the Western world. The August 4th issue of a newspaper titled 「美術界雑感XYZ」states that it is a shame that people find idealistic forms of art (理想画) such as Temptation better than realistic styles (写実画).
<br><br>
However, the allegorical, idealistic form of depicting Japanese figures was not an entirely new concept explored by Senko through Temptation and Middle Path. 構想画 (conceptual drawing?) actually started during the 1890s through explorations by Kuroda Seiki.. After Kuroda strayed from 構想画 (conceptual drawing?) to switch to a style that was more understandable to the audience, these explorations were continued by artists such as Fujishima Takeji and Aoki Shigeru. This was around the same time Senko started striving for idealistic paintings. In other words, in the midst of realistic styles, there was a new movement of romantic popularity and abstract expressions. With this context, it is no wonder that Aoki’s 「わだつみのいろこの宮」and Senko’s Temptation was exhibited in the same exhibition around this time. 
<br><br>
In contrast to Christianity serving as the foundation for Western culture and art, perhaps Senko’s mission was to depict Buddhism, more familiar to the Japanese audience, in a more modern art style, especially since he was a devout Buddhist himself. Temptation, his final work, is a testimony to this statement. In this painting, a goddess is trying to stop a girl from being led by the devil down a cliff. Ahead of the devil’s pointed hand is a grave marked with a cross, contrasting Japanese and West’s opposing forces. 
<br><br>
To conclude, although he was taught artistic history and techniques in Western countries, Senko’s ultimate goal was to use that in the context of Japanese subjects. However, despite Japan’s heightened patriotism in the age before the Russo-Japanese War, Senko’s pieces focusing on Japanese topics never reached high marks during his lifetime. Thus, his name faded from art history after his too-soon death.
<br><br>
In contrast to the high praise he received from his days as a student and artist in America, his time in Japan was met with rather strict criticism. However, given that the Japanese art industry was at a turning point, it is commendable that Senko strove to use the techniques he learned to create his own style rather than blindly following Western styles. For this, he is worthy to be called a prominent figure in laying the foundation for contemporary Japanese paintings.
